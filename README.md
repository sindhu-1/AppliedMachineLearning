# AppliedMachineLearning

The project applies Transfer learning for a multi label classification of chest x-ray images into various diseases. 
MobileNet, ResNet and EfficientNet are used as base models with additional layers to compare the classification accuracy for the task.  
Out of the three, EfficentNet Version 3 has the highest accuracy in classifying the images.
