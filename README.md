# AppliedMachineLearning Project
## Multi-class classification of chest X-ray images from

The project applies Transfer learning for a multi label classification of chest x-ray images into various diseases. 
MobileNet, ResNet and EfficientNet are used as base models with additional layers to compare the classification accuracy for the task.  


The project addresses the business case of classifying x-ray image data as first level diagnosis. 
The project applies existing state-of-the-art multi-layer CNN models such as MobileNet, ResNet & EfficientNet  and performed not only binary classification to detect any possible evidence of a disease but also by performing multi-class classification to detect the highest possibility of a disease occurrence based on the 5 label categories. One of the major focus was also to compare the model performance and hyper tuning parameters to maximize the optimization, all within the remit of available computation paradigm, model performance can be further improved to achieve higher accuracy with greater computational capability. 
Out of the three, EfficentNet Version 3, has the highest accuracy in classifying the images.

This project uses Google Colab and a laptop with 32GB ram to perform the training process.
